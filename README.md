# OceanOPS Telecom Types Vocabulary

This repository contains a controlled vocabulary describing data telecommunication
systems used by ocean observing platforms.

## Scope
This vocabulary is maintained by OceanOPS for operational coordination purposes.
It is intended to fill a gap where no suitable authoritative external controlled
vocabulary currently exists.

## Governance
- Terms are stable and identified by persistent slugs.
- This vocabulary is operational and non-normative.
- Future alignment with international standards (e.g. WMO, NVS) is anticipated.

## Contents
- `telecom-types.json` – canonical machine-readable vocabulary
- `telecom-types.csv` – tabular representation

> **Stability notice:**  
> The `code` field is the stable identifier for each vocabulary term and **must not be changed once published**.
